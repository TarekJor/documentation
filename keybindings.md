# Keybindings in TagSpaces

Keyboard shortcuts are combinations of two or more keys that you can use to perform a specific task that would typically require more than one mouse click. They are very useful and can make it easier to work with your software, saving you time and effort as you work with TagSpaces and other applications.

To use a keyboard shortcut, hold down one or more keys while pressing the last key of the shortcut. For example, to use the shortcut **Ctrl** + **C** on Windows and Linux or **Command** - **C** on Mac OS X, hold down **Ctrl** button, press **C** and then release both keys.

TagSpaces like a much of modern software also provides a range of keyboard shortcuts for better experience with it. Please find the list of the currently supported keyboard shortcuts bellow.

Here you can see all the keyboard shortcuts by default in TagSpaces, and what actions they perform. You also have the ability to change keyboard shortcuts by clicking on the field in which they were written. Before changing any of the binding, please read the following short instructions:

* For modifier keys you can use `shift`, `ctrl`, `alt`, `option`, `meta`, `command` and `mod`. The last one is special modifier allowing us to refer to the control and command key on Windows/Linux and OS X operating systems respectively.
* Other special keys are `backspace`, `tab`, `enter`, `return`, `capslock`, `esc`, `escape`, `space`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `end`, `home`, `left`, `up`, `right`, `down`, `ins` and `del`.
* Any other key you should be able to reference by name like `a`, `/`, `$`, `*`, `=`.
* You can assign many keys to a single operation, simply by separating them by `,`.
